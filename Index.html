<p>My Name is Joel Blais. I'm a cooperate .NET software developer, graduate of Computer Programmer Analyst at Fanshawe and a close friend of Zainab. Zainab asked me if I could let her borrow one of my github users for a collaboration on an assignment. Of course, I was willing to help. I use this account to keep track of repositories related to my DNS server with I run on a raspberry pi. The results of which act as a DNS sinkhole at the networking level, allowing only domains I say are safe to enter into my home network.</p>
